## About Me

I focus on distributed systems, low-level programming, and building reliable cloud services and scalable databases. My primary expertise is in databases (Postgres, Oracle, SQLite, SQL Server) and backend microservicesâ€”especially with Java/Spring Boot.

Iâ€™m comfortable working across Python, Ruby, C++, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Rust. My current main projects include:
- A finance microservices platform built in Spring Boot
- A Windows desktop chat application in C++
- Leading AI development (PyTorch) at Project Echoâ€”a multidisciplinary hearing aid initiative

I'm always learning, especially in C++ and advanced distributed systems. I also speak conversational Chinese.
